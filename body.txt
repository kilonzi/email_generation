Congratulations on your recent round of funding.
What you are doing is going to impact the law profession in a major way.
I look forward to seeing how you'll deploy your new resources to do it even faster.
Congratulations on your new role as VP Marketing. Based on your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've done an amazing job developing your career at [company].
If there are ways I can help you get your message out to my network of [title of people they're trying to reach], please connect me with the right people. I'm a fan and I want to help.
Do you have a PR or content person on your team?
Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that you've made i.e., search engine optimization. It's a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.
Welcome to town. My family and I enjoyed a nice dinner at your new Sudbury location last month. I really enjoyed the scallops and risotto. I'll be back.
I drove by your restaurant last night fairly late (I play indoor soccer at night ... I noticed that you were open, which is nice — I'll be bringing the guys by for a beer after next week's practice. But, I thought you were closed at first glance. I saw a few people sitting at the bar, but the light in front of the restaurant was really dim.
This isn't my area of expertise, but I know a good sign guy. Would you like an intro?
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with the world.
I love your wit and humor. I find myself nodding in agreement with your advice as I'm laughing out loud.
Your article the other day with the three email templates really inspired me. I forwarded to a few of my clients. One of them has really been struggling to connect with key prospects and we've implemented your advice. A prospect they've been trying to reach for a year now responded within an hour.
Would you like to see how my client applied your advice?
Best,
Was browsing through LinkedIn. Looks like you and I are both in [industry], and we're both snowboarding fans. Have you ever dreamed of having an industry conference at a ski resort? I have.
Have you gotten out this year? I got out to Loon last month. The powder was amazing.
Your salespeople seem to be struggling with acquiring new clients according to an informal survey I did. [Name #1], [Name #2], and [Name #3] seem to all be struggling with acquiring new clients as you've grown the team. Specifically, tare struggling to initiate a dialogue with prospects like tused to.
Is it a priority for you to improve their ability to put new opportunities in the funnel?
Two of your customers had excellent things to say about you: [Company #1] and [Company #2]. Your software has had a huge impact on the growth of their businesses.
How could I learn more about how your team pulls this off?
Your commercial real estate broker, [name], suggested I reach out to you. Someone in your organization told them conference room booking is a real challenge. Everything is always booked — even when people aren't in the room.
This is an easy fix if you're interested in solving this problem once and for all. Interested?
Best,
[Prospect]
My friend, [name], told me that you'd be willing to meet up with me to discuss my business and see if we might work together.
I reviewed your website and am particularly interested in learning more about your [service].
Do you have time in the near future? Here's a link to my calendar to make scheduling easier.
Jeetandra,
Your CEO posted an article about expanding globally which speaks highly of the work you're doing. Judging from a quick LinkedIn search, I can see you're the guy who is probably making that happen. Congrats on the success. I know it's hard to duplicate the success of the home office.
Usually, managing directors are involved with setting budgets and are under pressure from CFOs to minimize startup cost. I'm an expert at helping companies minimize these types of expenses.
I talk to people like you all day. Would you be interested in a checklist of ways to reduce expenses?
Your blog article about [topic] was excellent. Your ebook on the topic was even better. The part about [section] was amazing because [reason].
But, I had to click around your website quite a bit to find the ebook. Have you ever thought about putting a call to action on the blog post that encourages visitors to download your whitepaper on the same subject?
Here's an article on how and why to do this: [link]
Let me know what you think,
Congrats on closing your seed funding. That means you're probably starting to think about how you'll raise your A round.
Other founders report that it's 100x easier to raise money if they've already figured out how to profitably acquire customers.
I've found that David Skok's articles on unit economics are an amazing resource to help with that.
Here's one: http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/
Have you read them?
Yesterday, you liked my article on LinkedIn Pulse. What did you like about it?
Looks like you visited my LinkedIn profile the other day. Did I do something wrong?
Thanks for connecting with me on LinkedIn. From looking at your impressive career advancement from salesperson to sales director in just five years, I'm guessing you have some really valuable advice.
I read a few of your testimonials and I noticed that many of them said you put people first. Many of them said that you always drop what you're doing to listen to the concerns and ideas of your front line salespeople.
Would you be willing to contribute to an article I'm writing on that subject?
From your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've been working in aerospace for 20 years. I'm guessing you've been involved in many engineering advancements over the years.
I'm only two years into the aerospace industry. So, I lack some of the historical context I imagine you have.
I'm working on a new product for creep-feed grinding of titanium aerospace blades. If I confidentially shared some of my findings, would you be willing to give me feedback?
A colleague of mine is investigating solutions for predictive lead scoring. I've been following you online for a bit.
As an expert at sales, I'm wondering if you have any experience with any platforms or know anyone that does?
On LinkedIn, you posted a request for introductions to salespeople who successfully practice social selling.
I have a few that I could recommend. Would you like an introduction over email?
It looks like we both sell to CIOs in the Boston area. I meet with a handful of successful salespeople every week to talk about accounts, and we help each other with introductions to prospects. In some months, my networking group books me more meetings than my SDR.
Would you be interested in meeting for coffee to talk about how we might be able to help each other?
Our mutual contact, [referral partner], and I were having a conversation the other day about experts at [topic]. You were the person who came to their mind immediately.
I'm writing an article about [topic]. Would you be willing to review it?
Your article about your marketing program was very well-written. Great job ensuring that your sponsorship dollars reached your target market.
I left a comment on the article as it reminded me of [company X's] program. Do you see the similarities?
I used some software to evaluate the search rankings of the top 50 B2B accounting firms in the Boston area. Although your firm ranks in the top 25 according to the Business Journal, your search rankings are worse than the top 40.
Would you like to view the report?
Looks like you started a blog, but have stopped publishing. Often times, companies stop prioritizing blogging when results don't come immediately.
But did you know that companies that blog regularly generate 67% more leads than those that don't?
You look like you have an impressive amount of experience doing X. I'm designing a survey and will be asking 100 people with similar experiences in [role] and [industry] about their thoughts on Y.
If you had the opportunity to ask any question of 100 peers, what would you ask?
Thank you for your assistance in designing this survey. Will you take the survey now that it's ready? It's five questions long and should take you five minutes.
As soon as we have 100 respondents, I'll send you the preliminary results.
Looks like your marketing efforts support a pretty big sales team.
At HubSpot, we recently completed a survey of B2B buyers. We asked them to give one word that best describes salespeople. The most popular answer by far was "pushy."
Do you agree or disagree with this? Do you think your buyers think your salespeople are too pushy? Do you think this reduces the effectiveness of your marketing?
Your quarterly report shows an impressive growth rate, especially at your scale.
Fast growth companies like yours usually dedicate significant resources towards recruiting. We have some market research that shows how companies allocate resources to different parts of the recruiting process.
Would you be interested in seeing the report, so you can benchmark yourself?
I'm trying to reach the person who's in charge of implementing marketing software at your company.
I've helped businesses like yours increase marketing qualified leads by as much as 25%.
Could you help me get in touch with the right person?
Thanks for your time,
Congrats on your new role with XYC Recruiting. I work with [Your company name] helping teams like yours increase employee retention by up to 35%.
I'd love to talk with you about how your company could achieve the same results — and help you make a splash in your first few months.

Have you read them?
Yesterday, you liked my article on LinkedIn Pulse. What did you like about it?
Looks like you visited my LinkedIn profile the other day. Did I do something wrong?
Thanks for connecting with me on LinkedIn. From looking at your impressive career advancement from salesperson to sales director in just five years, I'm guessing you have some really valuable advice.
I read a few of your testimonials and I noticed that many of them said you put people first. Many of them said that you always drop what you're doing to listen to the concerns and ideas of your front line salespeople.
Would you be willing to contribute to an article I'm writing on that subject?
From your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've been working in aerospace for 20 years. I'm guessing you've been involved in many engineering advancements over the years.
I'm only two years into the aerospace industry. So, I lack some of the historical context I imagine you have.
I'm working on a new product for creep-feed grinding of titanium aerospace blades. If I confidentially shared some of my findings, would you be willing to give me feedback?
A colleague of mine is investigating solutions for predictive lead scoring. I've been following you online for a bit.
As an expert at sales, I'm wondering if you have any experience with any platforms or know anyone that does?
On LinkedIn, you posted a request for introductions to salespeople who successfully practice social selling.
I have a few that I could recommend. Would you like an introduction over email?
It looks like we both sell to CIOs in the Boston area. I meet with a handful of successful salespeople every week to talk about accounts, and we help each other with introductions to prospects. In some months, my networking group books me more meetings than my SDR.
Would you be interested in meeting for coffee to talk about how we might be able to help each other?
Our mutual contact, [referral partner], and I were having a conversation the other day about experts at [topic]. You were the person who came to their mind immediately.
I'm writing an article about [topic]. Would you be willing to review it?
Your article about your marketing program was very well-written. Great job ensuring that your sponsorship dollars reached your target market.
I left a comment on the article as it reminded me of [company X's] program. Do you see the similarities?
I used some software to evaluate the search rankings of the top 50 B2B accounting firms in the Boston area. Although your firm ranks in the top 25 according to the Business Journal, your search rankings are worse than the top 40.
Would you like to view the report?
Looks like you started a blog, but have stopped publishing. Often times, companies stop prioritizing blogging when results don't come immediately.
But did you know that companies that blog regularly generate 67% more leads than those that don't?
You look like you have an impressive amount of experience doing X. I'm designing a survey and will be asking 100 people with similar experiences in [role] and [industry] about their thoughts on Y.
If you had the opportunity to ask any question of 100 peers, what would you ask?
Thank you for your assistance in designing this survey. Will you take the survey now that it's ready? It's five questions long and should take you five minutes.
As soon as we have 100 respondents, I'll send you the preliminary results.
Looks like your marketing efforts support a pretty big sales team.
At HubSpot, we recently completed a survey of B2B buyers. We asked them to give one word that best describes salespeople. The most popular answer by far was "pushy."
Do you agree or disagree with this? Do you think your buyers think your salespeople are too pushy? Do you think this reduces the effectiveness of your marketing?
Your quarterly report shows an impressive growth rate, especially at your scale.
Fast growth companies like yours usually dedicate significant resources towards recruiting. We have some market research that shows how companies allocate resources to different parts of the recruiting process.
Would you be interested in seeing the report, so you can benchmark yourself?
I'm trying to reach the person who's in charge of implementing marketing software at your company.
I've helped businesses like yours increase marketing qualified leads by as much as 25%.
Could you help me get in touch with the right person?
Thanks for your time,
Congrats on your new role with XYC Recruiting. I work with [Your company name] helping teams like yours increase employee retention by up to 35%.
I'd love to talk with you about how your company could achieve the same results — and help you make a splash in your first few months.
Here's a link to my calendar, if you'd like to book some time: [Calendar link]
Congratulations on your recent round of funding.
What you are doing is going to impact the law profession in a major way.
I look forward to seeing how you'll deploy your new resources to do it even faster.
Congratulations on your new role as VP Marketing. Based on your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've done an amazing job developing your career at [company].
If there are ways I can help you get your message out to my network of [title of people they're trying to reach], please connect me with the right people. I'm a fan and I want to help.
Do you have a PR or content person on your team?
Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that you've made i.e., search engine optimization. It's a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.
Welcome to town. My family and I enjoyed a nice dinner at your new Sudbury location last month. I really enjoyed the scallops and risotto. I'll be back.
I drove by your restaurant last night fairly late (I play indoor soccer at night ... I noticed that you were open, which is nice — I'll be bringing the guys by for a beer after next week's practice. But, I thought you were closed at first glance. I saw a few people sitting at the bar, but the light in front of the restaurant was really dim.
This isn't my area of expertise, but I know a good sign guy. Would you like an intro?
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with the world.
I love your wit and humor. I find myself nodding in agreement with your advice as I'm laughing out loud.
Your article the other day with the three email templates really inspired me. I forwarded to a few of my clients. One of them has really been struggling to connect with key prospects and we've implemented your advice. A prospect they've been trying to reach for a year now responded within an hour.
Would you like to see how my client applied your advice?
Best,
Was browsing through LinkedIn. Looks like you and I are both in [industry], and we're both snowboarding fans. Have you ever dreamed of having an industry conference at a ski resort? I have.
Have you gotten out this year? I got out to Loon last month. The powder was amazing.
Your salespeople seem to be struggling with acquiring new clients according to an informal survey I did. [Name #1], [Name #2], and [Name #3] seem to all be struggling with acquiring new clients as you've grown the team. Specifically, tare struggling to initiate a dialogue with prospects like tused to.
Is it a priority for you to improve their ability to put new opportunities in the funnel?
Two of your customers had excellent things to say about you: [Company #1] and [Company #2]. Your software has had a huge impact on the growth of their businesses.
How could I learn more about how your team pulls this off?
Your commercial real estate broker, [name], suggested I reach out to you. Someone in your organization told them conference room booking is a real challenge. Everything is always booked — even when people aren't in the room.
This is an easy fix if you're interested in solving this problem once and for all. Interested?
Best,
[Prospect]
My friend, [name], told me that you'd be willing to meet up with me to discuss my business and see if we might work together.
I reviewed your website and am particularly interested in learning more about your [service].
Do you have time in the near future? Here's a link to my calendar to make scheduling easier.
Jeetandra,
Your CEO posted an article about expanding globally which speaks highly of the work you're doing. Judging from a quick LinkedIn search, I can see you're the guy who is probably making that happen. Congrats on the success. I know it's hard to duplicate the success of the home office.
Usually, managing directors are involved with setting budgets and are under pressure from CFOs to minimize startup cost. I'm an expert at helping companies minimize these types of expenses.
I talk to people like you all day. Would you be interested in a checklist of ways to reduce expenses?
Your blog article about [topic] was excellent. Your ebook on the topic was even better. The part about [section] was amazing because [reason].
But, I had to click around your website quite a bit to find the ebook. Have you ever thought about putting a call to action on the blog post that encourages visitors to download your whitepaper on the same subject?
Here's an article on how and why to do this: [link]
Let me know what you think,
Congrats on closing your seed funding. That means you're probably starting to think about how you'll raise your A round.
Other founders report that it's 100x easier to raise money if they've already figured out how to profitably acquire customers.
I've found that David Skok's articles on unit economics are an amazing resource to help with that.

If there are ways I can help you get your message out to my network of [title of people they're trying to reach], please connect me with the right people. I'm a fan and I want to help.
Do you have a PR or content person on your team?
Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that you've made i.e., search engine optimization. It's a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.
Welcome to town. My family and I enjoyed a nice dinner at your new Sudbury location last month. I really enjoyed the scallops and risotto. I'll be back.
I drove by your restaurant last night fairly late (I play indoor soccer at night ... I noticed that you were open, which is nice — I'll be bringing the guys by for a beer after next week's practice. But, I thought you were closed at first glance. I saw a few people sitting at the bar, but the light in front of the restaurant was really dim.
This isn't my area of expertise, but I know a good sign guy. Would you like an intro?
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with the world.
I love your wit and humor. I find myself nodding in agreement with your advice as I'm laughing out loud.
Your article the other day with the three email templates really inspired me. I forwarded to a few of my clients. One of them has really been struggling to connect with key prospects and we've implemented your advice. A prospect they've been trying to reach for a year now responded within an hour.
Would you like to see how my client applied your advice?
Best,
Was browsing through LinkedIn. Looks like you and I are both in [industry], and we're both snowboarding fans. Have you ever dreamed of having an industry conference at a ski resort? I have.
Have you gotten out this year? I got out to Loon last month. The powder was amazing.
Your salespeople seem to be struggling with acquiring new clients according to an informal survey I did. [Name #1], [Name #2], and [Name #3] seem to all be struggling with acquiring new clients as you've grown the team. Specifically, tare struggling to initiate a dialogue with prospects like tused to.
Is it a priority for you to improve their ability to put new opportunities in the funnel?
Two of your customers had excellent things to say about you: [Company #1] and [Company #2]. Your software has had a huge impact on the growth of their businesses.
How could I learn more about how your team pulls this off?
Your commercial real estate broker, [name], suggested I reach out to you. Someone in your organization told them conference room booking is a real challenge. Everything is always booked — even when people aren't in the room.
This is an easy fix if you're interested in solving this problem once and for all. Interested?
Best,
[Prospect]
My friend, [name], told me that you'd be willing to meet up with me to discuss my business and see if we might work together.
I reviewed your website and am particularly interested in learning more about your [service].
Do you have time in the near future? Here's a link to my calendar to make scheduling easier.
Jeetandra,
Your CEO posted an article about expanding globally which speaks highly of the work you're doing. Judging from a quick LinkedIn search, I can see you're the guy who is probably making that happen. Congrats on the success. I know it's hard to duplicate the success of the home office.
Usually, managing directors are involved with setting budgets and are under pressure from CFOs to minimize startup cost. I'm an expert at helping companies minimize these types of expenses.
I talk to people like you all day. Would you be interested in a checklist of ways to reduce expenses?
Your blog article about [topic] was excellent. Your ebook on the topic was even better. The part about [section] was amazing because [reason].
But, I had to click around your website quite a bit to find the ebook. Have you ever thought about putting a call to action on the blog post that encourages visitors to download your whitepaper on the same subject?
Here's an article on how and why to do this: [link]
Let me know what you think,
Congrats on closing your seed funding. That means you're probably starting to think about how you'll raise your A round.
Other founders report that it's 100x easier to raise money if they've already figured out how to profitably acquire customers.
I've found that David Skok's articles on unit economics are an amazing resource to help with that.
Here's one: http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/
Have you read them?
Yesterday, you liked my article on LinkedIn Pulse. What did you like about it?
Looks like you visited my LinkedIn profile the other day. Did I do something wrong?
Thanks for connecting with me on LinkedIn. From looking at your impressive career advancement from salesperson to sales director in just five years, I'm guessing you have some really valuable advice.
I read a few of your testimonials and I noticed that many of them said you put people first. Many of them said that you always drop what you're doing to listen to the concerns and ideas of your front line salespeople.
Would you be willing to contribute to an article I'm writing on that subject?
From your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've been working in aerospace for 20 years. I'm guessing you've been involved in many engineering advancements over the years.
I'm only two years into the aerospace industry. So, I lack some of the historical context I imagine you have.
I'm working on a new product for creep-feed grinding of titanium aerospace blades. If I confidentially shared some of my findings, would you be willing to give me feedback?
A colleague of mine is investigating solutions for predictive lead scoring. I've been following you online for a bit.
As an expert at sales, I'm wondering if you have any experience with any platforms or know anyone that does?
On LinkedIn, you posted a request for introductions to salespeople who successfully practice social selling.
I have a few that I could recommend. Would you like an introduction over email?
It looks like we both sell to CIOs in the Boston area. I meet with a handful of successful salespeople every week to talk about accounts, and we help each other with introductions to prospects. In some months, my networking group books me more meetings than my SDR.
Would you be interested in meeting for coffee to talk about how we might be able to help each other?
Our mutual contact, [referral partner], and I were having a conversation the other day about experts at [topic]. You were the person who came to their mind immediately.
I'm writing an article about [topic]. Would you be willing to review it?
Your article about your marketing program was very well-written. Great job ensuring that your sponsorship dollars reached your target market.
I left a comment on the article as it reminded me of [company X's] program. Do you see the similarities?
I used some software to evaluate the search rankings of the top 50 B2B accounting firms in the Boston area. Although your firm ranks in the top 25 according to the Business Journal, your search rankings are worse than the top 40.
Would you like to view the report?
Looks like you started a blog, but have stopped publishing. Often times, companies stop prioritizing blogging when results don't come immediately.
But did you know that companies that blog regularly generate 67% more leads than those that don't?
You look like you have an impressive amount of experience doing X. I'm designing a survey and will be asking 100 people with similar experiences in [role] and [industry] about their thoughts on Y.
If you had the opportunity to ask any question of 100 peers, what would you ask?
Thank you for your assistance in designing this survey. Will you take the survey now that it's ready? It's five questions long and should take you five minutes.
As soon as we have 100 respondents, I'll send you the preliminary results.
Looks like your marketing efforts support a pretty big sales team.
At HubSpot, we recently completed a survey of B2B buyers. We asked them to give one word that best describes salespeople. The most popular answer by far was "pushy."
Do you agree or disagree with this? Do you think your buyers think your salespeople are too pushy? Do you think this reduces the effectiveness of your marketing?
Your quarterly report shows an impressive growth rate, especially at your scale.
Fast growth companies like yours usually dedicate significant resources towards recruiting. We have some market research that shows how companies allocate resources to different parts of the recruiting process.
Would you be interested in seeing the report, so you can benchmark yourself?
I'm trying to reach the person who's in charge of implementing marketing software at your company.
I've helped businesses like yours increase marketing qualified leads by as much as 25%.
Could you help me get in touch with the right person?
Thanks for your time,
Congrats on your new role with XYC Recruiting. I work with [Your company name] helping teams like yours increase employee retention by up to 35%.
I'd love to talk with you about how your company could achieve the same results — and help you make a splash in your first few months.
Here's a link to my calendar, if you'd like to book some time: [Calendar link]
Congratulations on your recent round of funding.
What you are doing is going to impact the law profession in a major way.

Looks like you visited my LinkedIn profile the other day. Did I do something wrong?
Thanks for connecting with me on LinkedIn. From looking at your impressive career advancement from salesperson to sales director in just five years, I'm guessing you have some really valuable advice.
I read a few of your testimonials and I noticed that many of them said you put people first. Many of them said that you always drop what you're doing to listen to the concerns and ideas of your front line salespeople.
Would you be willing to contribute to an article I'm writing on that subject?
From your LinkedIn profile, it looks like you've been working in aerospace for 20 years. I'm guessing you've been involved in many engineering advancements over the years.
I'm only two years into the aerospace industry. So, I lack some of the historical context I imagine you have.
I'm working on a new product for creep-feed grinding of titanium aerospace blades. If I confidentially shared some of my findings, would you be willing to give me feedback?
A colleague of mine is investigating solutions for predictive lead scoring. I've been following you online for a bit.
As an expert at sales, I'm wondering if you have any experience with any platforms or know anyone that does?
On LinkedIn, you posted a request for introductions to salespeople who successfully practice social selling.
I have a few that I could recommend. Would you like an introduction over email?
It looks like we both sell to CIOs in the Boston area. I meet with a handful of successful salespeople every week to talk about accounts, and we help each other with introductions to prospects. In some months, my networking group books me more meetings than my SDR.
Would you be interested in meeting for coffee to talk about how we might be able to help each other?
Our mutual contact, [referral partner], and I were having a conversation the other day about experts at [topic]. You were the person who came to their mind immediately.
I'm writing an article about [topic]. Would you be willing to review it?
Your article about your marketing program was very well-written. Great job ensuring that your sponsorship dollars reached your target market.
I left a comment on the article as it reminded me of [company X's] program. Do you see the similarities?
I used some software to evaluate the search rankings of the top 50 B2B accounting firms in the Boston area. Although your firm ranks in the top 25 according to the Business Journal, your search rankings are worse than the top 40.
Would you like to view the report?
Looks like you started a blog, but have stopped publishing. Often times, companies stop prioritizing blogging when results don't come immediately.
But did you know that companies that blog regularly generate 67% more leads than those that don't?
You look like you have an impressive amount of experience doing X. I'm designing a survey and will be asking 100 people with similar experiences in [role] and [industry] about their thoughts on Y.
If you had the opportunity to ask any question of 100 peers, what would you ask?
Thank you for your assistance in designing this survey. Will you take the survey now that it's ready? It's five questions long and should take you five minutes.
As soon as we have 100 respondents, I'll send you the preliminary results.
Looks like your marketing efforts support a pretty big sales team.
At HubSpot, we recently completed a survey of B2B buyers. We asked them to give one word that best describes salespeople. The most popular answer by far was "pushy."
Do you agree or disagree with this? Do you think your buyers think your salespeople are too pushy? Do you think this reduces the effectiveness of your marketing?
Your quarterly report shows an impressive growth rate, especially at your scale.
Fast growth companies like yours usually dedicate significant resources towards recruiting. We have some market research that shows how companies allocate resources to different parts of the recruiting process.
Would you be interested in seeing the report, so you can benchmark yourself?
I'm trying to reach the person who's in charge of implementing marketing software at your company.
I've helped businesses like yours increase marketing qualified leads by as much as 25%.
Could you help me get in touch with the right person?
Thanks for your time,
Congrats on your new role with XYC Recruiting. I work with [Your company name] helping teams like yours increase employee retention by up to 35%.
I'd love to talk with you about how your company could achieve the same results — and help you make a splash in your first few months.

Do you have a PR or content person on your team?
Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that you've made i.e., search engine optimization. It's a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.
Welcome to town. My family and I enjoyed a nice dinner at your new Sudbury location last month. I really enjoyed the scallops and risotto. I'll be back.
I drove by your restaurant last night fairly late (I play indoor soccer at night ... I noticed that you were open, which is nice — I'll be bringing the guys by for a beer after next week's practice. But, I thought you were closed at first glance. I saw a few people sitting at the bar, but the light in front of the restaurant was really dim.
This isn't my area of expertise, but I know a good sign guy. Would you like an intro?
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with the world.
I love your wit and humor. I find myself nodding in agreement with your advice as I'm laughing out loud.
Your article the other day with the three email templates really inspired me. I forwarded to a few of my clients. One of them has really been struggling to connect with key prospects and we've implemented your advice. A prospect they've been trying to reach for a year now responded within an hour.
Would you like to see how my client applied your advice?
Best,
Was browsing through LinkedIn. Looks like you and I are both in [industry], and we're both snowboarding fans. Have you ever dreamed of having an industry conference at a ski resort? I have.
Have you gotten out this year? I got out to Loon last month. The powder was amazing.
Your salespeople seem to be struggling with acquiring new clients according to an informal survey I did. [Name #1], [Name #2], and [Name #3] seem to all be struggling with acquiring new clients as you've grown the team. Specifically, tare struggling to initiate a dialogue with prospects like tused to.
Is it a priority for you to improve their ability to put new opportunities in the funnel?
Two of your customers had excellent things to say about you: [Company #1] and [Company #2]. Your software has had a huge impact on the growth of their businesses.
How could I learn more about how your team pulls this off?
Your commercial real estate broker, [name], suggested I reach out to you. Someone in your organization told them conference room booking is a real challenge. Everything is always booked — even when people aren't in the room.
This is an easy fix if you're interested in solving this problem once and for all. Interested?
Best,
[Prospect]
My friend, [name], told me that you'd be willing to meet up with me to discuss my business and see if we might work together.
I reviewed your website and am particularly interested in learning more about your [service].
Do you have time in the near future? Here's a link to my calendar to make scheduling easier.
Jeetandra,
Your CEO posted an article about expanding globally which speaks highly of the work you're doing. Judging from a quick LinkedIn search, I can see you're the guy who is probably making that happen. Congrats on the success. I know it's hard to duplicate the success of the home office.
Usually, managing directors are involved with setting budgets and are under pressure from CFOs to minimize startup cost. I'm an expert at helping companies minimize these types of expenses.
I talk to people like you all day. Would you be interested in a checklist of ways to reduce expenses?
Your blog article about [topic] was excellent. Your ebook on the topic was even better. The part about [section] was amazing because [reason].
But, I had to click around your website quite a bit to find the ebook. Have you ever thought about putting a call to action on the blog post that encourages visitors to download your whitepaper on the same subject?
Here's an article on how and why to do this: [link]
Let me know what you think,
Congrats on closing your seed funding. That means you're probably starting to think about how you'll raise your A round.
Other founders report that it's 100x easier to raise money if they've already figured out how to profitably acquire customers.
I've found that David Skok's articles on unit economics are an amazing resource to help with that.
